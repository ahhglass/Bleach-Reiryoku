**Bleach: Reiryoku** project contributing guide

## Overview

The process of contributing to the project is described in detail in this document.

## Code of Conduct

The first thing to do is to read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Types of contributing

There are two main types of contributions: submitting issues about problems and submitting pull requests. Each of these types is described below.

## Issues

You can help us by submitting issues to the repository:

- **Bug reports** — if you find a bug in the mod (items, crafting, balance, etc.) and want to report it
- **Feature requests** — if you think the mod is missing a feature or you have an idea for new content

When opening an issue, please describe the problem or idea clearly. You can also reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7My4sVvafk) for quick questions.

## Pull requests

You can also help by submitting pull requests. The process:

- Find what you want to implement or improve
- Fork the repository
- Create a branch (e.g. `feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`)
- Make and test your changes in Hytale
- Create commits with clear messages
- Open a pull request
- Wait for review; we may ask for adjustments before merging

When a pull request is submitted, at least one project member will review it. After any requested changes, the PR can be merged.
